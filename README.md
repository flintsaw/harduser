CREATED FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY. Fork as you like.

This bash script simplifies the implementation of settings, installation of specific programs, and security improvements on a fresh install of PureOS. The use case is broad enough to suit most privacy-aware users. There will be no documentation beyond comments in the script itself. Don't run wget unless you know and trust the source or understand the code.
